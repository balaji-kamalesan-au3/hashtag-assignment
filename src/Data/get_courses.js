// Explanation of this file - 
//  I have extracted this courses JSON from NPTEL's Information on courses tab "https://nptel.ac.in/"
//  Steps to Organise the data :
//  Step 1 => I have extracted out each Discipline (eg : Computer Science Engineering, Mathematics) from the JSON into an array called Disciplines
//  Step 2 => Created a function "addCourses" to add all the courses in a particular discipline into a single object called organisedCourses
//  Final Output  => organisedCourses = {Aerospace Engineering: Array(10), Agriculture Engineering: Array(7), Applied mechanics: Array(2), Architecture And Planning: Array(14), Biotechnology & Bioengineering: Array(26), …}
